            I was born in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Since my childhood I has access to computer because my parents has a lan house. I knew HTML around the 2010s decade, when I created a blog to share my experiences with Club Penguin. Games are my hobbie since early and in 2015 I entered in a technical course focused in programming to develop skills to create my own games. In this course, I has my first contact with others languages focused in frontend development, like CSS and Javascript, and I discovered a great afinity with these skills.

            After my high school, I started my studies at Impacta - a university focused in technology based in Brazil - in Analysis and Development Systems. I started to go in many hackathons to increase my hard and soft skills, and in August, 2018, I entered in a internship at Prefeitura de SÃ£o Paulo.
